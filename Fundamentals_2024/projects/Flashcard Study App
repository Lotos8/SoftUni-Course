Project Overview
The Flashcard Study App is a Python-based project where students create, organize, and review flashcards to study various topics. The app will utilize dictionaries to store flashcards, each containing a question and answer pair. This project helps students build practical skills in dictionary management, as they perform tasks like adding, updating, retrieving, and deleting flashcards from a dictionary database.

Learning Objectives
Gain experience using Python dictionaries to store, update, and retrieve data.
Practice CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on dictionary entries.
Build a text-based application that simulates a digital flashcard review experience.
Implement user interaction for real-time flashcard creation, review, and management.
🔧 Project Requirements
Python Version: Python 3.8 or above.
Libraries: No external libraries are required.
Version Control: Use Git/GitHub to manage project progress.
🎯 Key Functionalities
Create Flashcards: Users can add new flashcards by entering a question and answer pair.
Edit Flashcards: Users can update existing questions or answers.
Review Flashcards: Randomly display a question for users to answer, with the option to show the answer if they need it.
Delete Flashcards: Users can remove a flashcard if it is no longer needed.
List Flashcards: Display all flashcards available in the system.
Project Breakdown and Structure
1. Flashcard Class
Description: This class manages individual flashcards, which include a question and answer. Each flashcard is stored as a key-value pair within a dictionary.

Attributes:

question: The flashcard question.
answer: The answer to the flashcard question.
Methods:

display_question(): Display the question.
display_answer(): Display the answer.
Example:

class Flashcard:
    def __init__(self, question, answer):
        self.question = question
        self.answer = answer

    def display_question(self):
        return f"Question: {self.question}"

    def display_answer(self):
        return f"Answer: {self.answer}"
2. FlashcardManager Class
Description: This class manages all flashcards using a dictionary, where each entry stores a Flashcard instance with the question as the key.

Attributes:

flashcards: A dictionary to store flashcards, where the question is the key and the Flashcard object is the value.
Methods:

add_flashcard(question, answer): Add a new flashcard.
edit_flashcard(question, new_question, new_answer): Edit an existing flashcard.
delete_flashcard(question): Delete a flashcard.
list_flashcards(): Display all flashcards.
review_flashcard(): Pick a random flashcard to display for review.
Example:

import random

class FlashcardManager:
    def __init__(self):
        self.flashcards = {}

    def add_flashcard(self, question, answer):
        self.flashcards[question] = Flashcard(question, answer)

    def edit_flashcard(self, question, new_question, new_answer):
        if question in self.flashcards:
            self.flashcards[new_question] = Flashcard(new_question, new_answer)
            if new_question != question:
                del self.flashcards[question]

    def delete_flashcard(self, question):
        if question in self.flashcards:
            del self.flashcards[question]

    def list_flashcards(self):
        for question, flashcard in self.flashcards.items():
            print(flashcard.display_question())

    def review_flashcard(self):
        if self.flashcards:
            question = random.choice(list(self.flashcards.keys()))
            flashcard = self.flashcards[question]
            print(flashcard.display_question())
            input("Press Enter to show the answer...")
            print(flashcard.display_answer())
        else:
            print("No flashcards to review!")
Suggested Project Workflow
Create Basic Flashcards:

Start by defining the Flashcard and FlashcardManager classes.
Implement adding and listing flashcards.
Implement CRUD Operations:

Add editing and deleting capabilities in the FlashcardManager class.
Add Review Functionality:

Implement the review_flashcard() method for random review of flashcards.
Build a Menu System:

Create a basic interface in the main script to navigate flashcard options:
Add Flashcard
Edit Flashcard
Delete Flashcard
List Flashcards
Review Flashcards

Sample User Flow
Menu Display:

The user is prompted with options to add, edit, delete, list, or review flashcards.
Create Flashcard:

User inputs a question and answer, which are saved as a dictionary entry in flashcards.
Review Mode:

A random question is displayed for the user to answer mentally, with an option to display the correct answer.
